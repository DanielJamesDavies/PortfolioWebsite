	"description": "A mechanistic interpretability tool to understand the internals of Turing‑LLM, a large language model.\n\nUsing this tool, one can navigate the sparse autoencoder latent space of Turing‑LLM‑1.0‑254M and gain an understanding of how these large language models may function internally.\n\nRun the Turing‑LLM base model and view connections between top latents to better understand how latents work together to form thoughts.",
